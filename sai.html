  <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
  <P>Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, is a nationwide cleanliness campaign launched by the Indian government on October 2, 2014. The campaign aims to make India a clean and hygienic country by focusing on sanitation and promoting cleanliness practices.The initiative was spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who called for a mass movement to achieve a clean India by 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was inspired by Gandhi's vision of a clean and healthy India and his emphasis on cleanliness as an essential part of individual and community life.

The campaign focuses on several key areas, including construction of household toilets, community and public toilets, solid waste management, and behavioral change regarding sanitation practices. The government has implemented various measures to achieve these goals, including financial incentives for constructing household toilets, promoting cleanliness and hygiene through media campaigns, and engaging celebrities and public figures to raise awareness.</P>
<h1>OBJECTIVE</h1>
<P>The primary objective of Swachh Bharat, also known as the Clean India Mission, is to achieve a cleaner and healthier India by promoting cleanliness and sanitation. with the aim of eliminating open defecation, improving solid waste management, and creating awareness about the importance of hygiene and cleanliness.</P>
<p>The specific objectives of Swachh Bharat include:</p>
<p>1.Sanitation and Toilet Facilities: One of the main objectives of the campaign is to ensure access to improved sanitation facilities for all individuals across the country. This includes the construction of household toilets, community toilets, and public toilets to eliminate open defecation and promote proper sanitation practices</p>
<p>2.Solid Waste Management: The campaign aims to address the issue of solid waste management by promoting proper waste segregation, collection, transportation, and disposal. </p>
<p>3.Behavior Change: Swachh Bharat Abhiyan seeks to bring about a behavioral change among individuals and communities towards cleanliness and hygiene. It focuses on promoting good hygiene practices such as handwashing with soap, using toilets, and maintaining cleanliness in public spaces.</p>
<h1>CHALLENGES</h1>
<p>POOR SANITATION:Poor sanitation poses numerous challenges that have far-reaching impacts on individuals, communities, and societies as a whole.  Inadequate sanitation facilities, such as lack of access to clean water, proper toilets, and handwashing facilities, contribute to the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A. </p>
<P>PLASTIC USAGE:Plastic usage poses several challenges for people, both at the individual and societal levelOne of the biggest challenges of plastic usage is its detrimental impact on the environment. Plastics are non-biodegradable and can persist in the environment for hundreds of years. Improper disposal and littering result in plastic waste entering water bodies, soil, and ecosystems, causing pollution and harming wildlife</P>
<P>GARBAGE DISPOSAL: Many regions lack proper waste management infrastructure, including an inadequate number of waste collection points, recycling facilities, and landfill sites. This leads to inefficient garbage disposal and accumulation of waste in inappropriate places.</P>
<h1>MY ACTIVITY</h1>
<P>I have taken permission from sachivalayam to start survey.After I sarted survey in near by areas .I explained the people the disadvantages of throwing waste in empty areas and also the proper garbage disposal.I conducted many awareness camps on usage of plastic.people using plastic for every small needs so I made aware of them to use cotton or jute bags in place of plastic bags And on the other side  usage of hygiene toilets is must for a good health explained about the using household toilets rather than open areas.I observed that many people spit on roads which shows the lack of awareness in people.I also observed the poor sanitation system in many houses I suggested them to improve the sanitation system .I have told them to make use of dustbins in public places like parks,roads etc. </P>
