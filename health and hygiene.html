    <P>There is so much competition at every step in life. Each person wants to outshine the other, be it at the school or college level or at maintaining a lifestyle later in life and their health takes a backseat. People must recognize the fact that health comes first. It is only when we are healthy we can work better on other aspects in life. The government must also provide good healthcare facilities for the betterment of the country.</P>
